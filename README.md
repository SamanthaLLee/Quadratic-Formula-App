# Quadratic-Formula-App
Final project for Intro to Programming (2016)

The application Q guides the user through the procedure of the quadratic formula. Though prior knowledge of basic algebra is essential, information pertaining to specifically quadratics is provided. Moreover, Q does not cover the topic of complex numbers/imaginary solutions, but only real ones. After a brief, concise tutorial that teaches the user about the different components of quadratic formulas and equations, a test can be taken to assess knowledge.
